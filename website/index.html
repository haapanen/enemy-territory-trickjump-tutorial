                <h1 id="strafejump">Strafejump</h1>
                <p>The goal of this tutorial is to teach the very basics of strafejumping that is a crucial part of every trickjumpers
                    knowledge.</p>
                <h2 id="what-is-a-strafejump-">What is a strafejump?</h2>
                <p>Strafejump is a way to jump further than with a regular jump. It allows players to move from one place to
                    another much faster. Trickjumping in Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory is essentially based on it. It is caused
                    by a bug in the game engine. The bug will be discussed later in the strafejumping theory section.</p>
                <h2 id="how-to-perform-a-strafejump-">How to perform a strafejump?</h2>
                <p>Basically a player can perform a strafejump just by pressing a strafe key (W or A) while moving forward just
                    before jumping. This will easily improve the speed gain by 15 %. Normally when a player sprints and jumps,
                    the maximum horizontal speed will be 352 units per second. Just by holding a strafe key while jumping
                    normally you can reach speeds of over 400 units per second.</p>
                <h2 id="what-is-a-circle-strafe-jump-and-how-to-perform-it-">What is a circle strafe jump and how to perform it?</h2>
                <p>Strafejumping without mouse movement allows players gain some additional speed. By adding correct mouse movement
                    it is possible to gain speed increases of over 70 %. A properly performed circle strafe jump where the
                    player turns slightly over 90 degrees can easily reach horizontal speeds of 600 units per second meaning
                    you can jump a lot further. The turning is in key role when trying to reach higher speeds (and longer
                    jumps) but even minor turns will further increase speed gain.</p>
                <p>When a player wants to perform a circle strafe jump, they should perform a regular strafejump and additionally
                    start turning to the strafejump direction just before hitting the jump key. The turning should continue
                    as long as the player is in the air. If you stop turning beforehand, the acceleration will stop. Because
                    you are turning to gain speed, you must start a circle strafe jump by going at another direction (e.g.
                    90 or more degrees to the left or right). Right before you jump you should quickly turn around 90 degrees
                    and while you are in the air you should move mouse slowly to that direction. This is demonstrated in
                    the video below.</p>

                <h1 id="overbounce">Overbounce</h1>
                <p>This tutorial aims to teach you how to jump overbounce jumps. It will cover the OB detector, sticky, &quot;regular&quot;
                    overbounce and &quot;vertical&quot; overbounce.</p>
                <h2 id="what-is-overbounce-">What is overbounce?</h2>
                <p>Overbounce is simply a speed boost you get when hitting a platform at certain speeds, so essentially when
                    falling from certain heights. It can be used to to perform tricks that would otherwise be impossible,
                    so it&#39;s good to know how it&#39;s done.</p>
                <p>OB heights can be calculated, but trickjumpers don&#39;t have to worry about that. In etjump there&#39;s
                    something called an overbounce detector which can be enabled with the cvar <code>etj_drawOB &quot;1&quot;</code>.</p>
                <h2 id="how-the-overbounce-detector-works">How the overbounce detector works</h2>
                <p>The OB detector is there to show you when you can overbounce. It does this by showing you 3 different letters:
                    <strong>F</strong>, <strong>J</strong> and <strong>B</strong>, which are short for Fall, Jump and Below.</p>
                <p><strong>F</strong> (Fall) shows when you are aiming at a surface that will give you an overbounce if you
                    simply fall there from where you are now. It will take into account your vertical speed, so it works
                    while you&#39;re in the air, as well.</p>
                <p><strong>B</strong> (Below) works very much like <strong>F</strong>, but instead of showing up when you aim
                    at a surface that will give you an overbounce, it shows when such a surface is directly under you. You
                    can imagine it drawing a straight line from your feet to the ground. It will only work when you&#39;re
                    in the air (or holding on to a ladder).</p>
                <p><strong>J</strong> (Jump) indicates Jump OB heights. When you&#39;re standing on a surface and pointing at
                    a surface, it will show if jumping from your current surface to the one you&#39;re pointing at will give
                    you an overbounce.</p>
                <h2 id="sticky">Sticky</h2>
                <p>Often when you fall from a small overbounce height, which is common, you will &quot;have a sticky&quot; afterwards.
                    This will prevent you from doing most overbounce jumps.</p>
                <p>The OB detector will show you if you have a sticky, if you aim at the surface you&#39;re standing on. It
                    will show either <strong>FJ</strong> or just <strong>F</strong>. You can get rid of the sticky by jumping
                    while standing still, either twice or just once depending on whether you had <strong>FJ</strong> or <strong>F</strong>.
                    Remember to save after jumping or you will have to do it again the next time you load.</p>
                <p>Some overbounce jumps require you to have a sticky, but those are less common. The heights for sticky overbounce
                    jumps are different from the non-sticky ones.</p>
                <h2 id="regular-overbounce">Regular overbounce</h2>
                <p>This type of overbounce is simple. You just delay pressing space as you hit a surface. If you hold jump before
                    you hit the ground, you won&#39;t get a speed boost. You have to press space immediately after you hit
                    the ground though, or you&#39;ll lose the speed you gained because of friction.</p>
                <p>When falling to a slick (icy) surface, you will simply get a boost and keep the additional speed even if
                    you don&#39;t jump at all.</p>
                <h2 id="vertical-overbounce">Vertical overbounce</h2>
                <p>A vertical overbounce (VOB) allows you bounce up(not directly) with the speed you gain from your fall. There
                    are a few conditions that have to be met, though:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>you need to fall from an overbounce height (obviously)</li>
                    <li>your horizontal speed has to be 0 units per second when you touch the ground</li>
                    <li>you need to use <code>+strafe</code> and move your mouse</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Before you start attempting VOB jumps, you will need to bind <code>+strafe</code>. Bind it to any key you
                    like, but use a key that you can easily reach.</p>
                <p>There are also a few cvars you might find useful:</p>
                <pre><code>etj_drawSpeed2
m_side
m_forward
</code></pre>
                <p>Setting your <code>etj_drawSpeed2</code> to <code>1</code> will show you a speedometer that you can use to
                    verify that your horizontal speed is 0 UPS.</p>
                <p><code>m_side</code> and <code>m_forward</code> change your mouse sensitivity when using +strafe. Some people
                    choose to set their <code>m_side</code> to <code>0</code>, so that they can only bounce backwards and
                    forwards. If you find you&#39;re constantly bouncing too low, either move your mouse slower or lower
                    your <code>m_forward</code>, or both.</p>
                <p>To do a vertical overbounce:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Find an overbounce height (<strong>F</strong> or <strong>J</strong>).</li>
                    <li>Fall or Jump down to the surface.</li>
                    <li>Reset your horizontal speed while in the air, for example by hitting a wall directly or hitting a corner.</li>
                    <li>Hold your <code>+strafe</code> button when hitting the surface, and move your mouse to the direction
                        you want to go.</li>
                    <li>Do <em>not</em> jump.</li>
                    <li>Do <em>not</em> press any of your movement keys until after you have bounced.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>If you move your mouse slower, you will bounce higher with less horizontal speed. If you move your mouse
                    faster, you will bounce lower but with higher horizontal speed. Whether or not you use sprint changes
                    the set of speeds you are able to get from the bounce.</p>
                <p>Gaining speed after a vertical overbounce is done the same way as usual.</p>
