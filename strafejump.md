# Strafejump

The goal of this tutorial is to teach the very basics of strafejumping that is a crucial part of every trickjumpers knowledge.

## What is a strafejump?

Strafejump is a way to jump further than with a regular jump. It allows players to move from one place to another much faster. Trickjumping in Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory is essentially based on it. It is caused by a bug in the game engine. The bug will be discussed later in the strafejumping theory section.

## How to perform a strafejump?

Basically a player can perform a strafejump just by pressing a strafe key (W or A) while moving forward just before jumping. This will easily improve the speed gain by 15 %. Normally when a player sprints and jumps, the maximum horizontal speed will be 352 units per second. Just by holding a strafe key while jumping normally you can reach speeds of over 400 units per second.

## What is a circle strafe jump and how to perform it?

Strafejumping without mouse movement allows players gain some additional speed. By adding correct mouse movement it is possible to gain speed increases of over 70 %. A properly performed circle strafe jump where the player turns slightly over 90 degrees can easily reach horizontal speeds of 600 units per second meaning you can jump a lot further. The turning is in key role when trying to reach higher speeds (and longer jumps) but even minor turns will further increase speed gain.

When a player wants to perform a circle strafe jump, they should perform a regular strafejump and additionally start turning to the strafejump direction just before hitting the jump key. The turning should continue as long as the player is in the air. If you stop turning beforehand, the acceleration will stop. Because you are turning to gain speed, you must start a circle strafe jump by going at another direction (e.g. 90 or more degrees to the left or right). Right before you jump you should quickly turn around 90 degrees and while you are in the air you should move mouse slowly to that direction. This is demonstrated in the video below.
